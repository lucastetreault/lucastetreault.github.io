                                        <h2>Leadership Competencies</h2>
                                        <p>I am an experienced IT leader with a proven track record of leading a
                                            customer-centric organization with a focus on innovation, best practices and
                                            standards. At Vivvo I have had the opportunity to design and lead the
                                            development and launch of two new products, grow the customer base by a
                                            factor of 5 and strategically direct development teams and technical vision
                                            of the company.</p>

                                        <p>I am comfortable leading client engagements at every stage from RFP responses
                                            to solution and technical design. Working with a Canadian province, I
                                            designed a modern, web-based experience with digital identity verification
                                            for renewing vehicle registrations that preserved their investment in a
                                            legacy system that would have cost them $8 million or more to replace. I
                                            lead the solution and technical design and directed development and business
                                            teams in the implementation of a production ready proof of concept that was
                                            delivered for less than $50,000 – a 160x cost savings over replacing the
                                            legacy system. This resulted in that province signing on as a customer and
                                            planning their production implementation.</p>

                                        <p>Leading Vivvo through startup-up to scale-up has meant being incredibly
                                            responsive to customers and corporate strategy being focused on RFP
                                            responses. I am constantly visioning product development path, and how to
                                            budget and resource it all while championing Vivvo’s corporate values and
                                            enabling continuous innovation. I empower employees and grow talent at every
                                            level of the organization to support these efforts. Recently, a service desk
                                            analyst showed interest and aptitude in Vivvo’s cloud deployments and I was
                                            able to coach and mentor him through the design and development of a new
                                            process that reduced creation of a new environment from several days to less
                                            than 45 minutes.</p>

                                        <h2>Learning and Innovation</h2>

                                        <p>I have a passion for learning, and I thrive when working on something new,
                                            innovative and leading-edge. I am an avid reader of books, blogs and
                                            technical documentation and often find myself researching a topic in depth
                                            just for the sake of learning. With the recent security flaws exposed in
                                            Zoom, I spent several weeks researching WebRTC, ICE and TURN – the
                                            technologies that underlay most modern web-based video conferencing
                                            systems.</p>

                                        <p>I aim to read at least one technical, business or innovation-oriented book
                                            every month. I recently read three books by Steven Kotler and Peter
                                            Diamandis that I found inspiring and thought-provoking: Bold, Abundance, and
                                            The Future Is Faster Than You Think. These books provide of summary of
                                            leading-edge research and innovation taking place today, and what the future
                                            could be because of that work.</p>

                                        <p>As a member of the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada’s (DIACC)
                                            Innovation Expert Committee, I collaborate with senior leaders across the
                                            country on identifying business requirements and priorities for adoption of
                                            innovative identity services and solutions in Canada. Through DIACC, I have
                                            had the opportunity to contribute to emerging digital identity standards
                                            such as the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, engage with public and private
                                            sector leaders working on blockchain-based identity and credential
                                            solutions, and speak at conferences in Canada and the USA on topics such as
                                            digital transformation, self-sovereign identity and digital credentials.</p>

                                        <p>To keep my technical skills up to date, and to expose myself to new
                                            technologies I experiment with small projects such as a toy BitTorrent
                                            client and a browser-based crypto-wallet. I maintain a personal website that
                                            I have used to experiment with various infrastructure configurations and
                                            cloud providers over the years. I compete in Google’s Kick Start and Code
                                            Jam coding competitions and the Advent of Code.</p>
