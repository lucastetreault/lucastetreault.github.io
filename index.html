      description: >
        I was assigned as a Senior Application Developer for 6 months and worked closely with the client to build, using Node.js/Express/Docker, an e-commerce system. The initial launch was for a specific product and had minimal integration to order management systems. Version two included integrating with legacy systems to fully automate order processing. The resulting application is a generic e-commerce system that will be able to support all of their products. All of the delivered micro services are automatically built, tested and deployed to Openshift in Docker containers.

        Farm Credit Canada is a Canadian Government Crown Corporation that provides consumer and mortgage loans, and leases to Canadian farmers and agribusiness. I started on the SAP ABAP development team building SOAP/REST services on and extending functionality of SAP CML and CMS. I quickly became familiar with the legacy tech stack, a monolithic Java application with a Swing based half-object model UI framework (Canoo ULC). I helped move FCC to a micro service and micro site architecture using Spring Boot and modern web technologies: AngularJS and eventually Angular (2/4).
